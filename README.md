# Mathematical Physics Practicum
Code and reports for the projects done during the mathematical physics practicum course at the faculty of mathematics and physics, university of Ljubljana.
Most of the code is written for specific problems and needs to be modified for general usage.

### List of Projects
1. Airy functions (expansions)
2. Random Walk
3. Hamiltonian Diagonalization
4. Discrete Fourier Transform
5. FFT
6. First Order ODE
7. Higher Order ODE
8. Boundary Value Problem
9. PDE - Spectral Methods
10. PDE - Difference Methods
11. PDE - Laplace Eigenfunctions
12. PDE - Galerkin Method
